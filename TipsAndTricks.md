# Codaic / Tips & Tricks

## Writing Long Scripts

Codaic's core philosophy is to reduce coding effort by providing pre-built nodes that you simply connect together. However, implementing complex algorithms still requires manual coding, and a smartphone's screen isn't ideal for this task. While I work on a remote editor feature, here are two practical alternatives:

1. Connect a Bluetooth keyboard to your phone.
2. If you have a macOS device, use the built-in "iPhone Mirroring" feature.

> **Note:** I've discovered an issue where the vibrator doesn't work after using iPhone Mirroring to write code. You can resolve this by restarting the app and running the code directly on your phone's screen. This issue may affect other components as well.
